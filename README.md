## Overview

This package implements different estimators of the expected calibration error
(ECE), the squared kernel calibration error (SKCE), and the
unnormalized calibration mean embedding (UCME) in the Julia language.

This package supports calibration error estimation of classification models that output vectors of class probabilities. In addition, SKCE and UCME can be estimated for more general probabilistic predictive models that output probability distributions defined in [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl) such as normal and Laplace distributions.

## Example

Calibration errors can be estimated from a data set of predicted probability distributions
and a set of corresponding observed targets by executing
```julia
estimator(predictions, targets)
```

The sets of predictions and targets have to be provided as vectors.

This package implements the estimator `ECE` of the ECE, the estimator `SKCE` for the SKCE
(unbiased and biased variants with different sample complexity), and `UCME` for the UCME.
